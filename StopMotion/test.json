Additional stuff on the screen is annoying
Missing stuff on the screen is annoying

Do we really need this fat text all over the screen?
My ears don't work too well, sue me!

Audio is too loud, kids are waking up and my ears are bleeding
I still can't hear what they say!

I wish I could watch this alone, like, fullscreen...
He hates me.

I am enjoying this immensely!
I wish I could understand anything of this film, can't even hear what they are saying...

What are they doing? What's a "balfrog defence"? What's with the purple line?
He's loving the game, can't wait to the balfrog gets it! He's so going to yell out!

This would have been nicer together
This would have been nicer together

What's happening?
This is intense!

1: Accessibility is the worst.
2: What? Why?
1: The text is too visible and the sign language translator takes like 40% of the screen.
2: Yeah. You know, it's just because it's not done right...
1: Really? How so?
2: Well, people are different, right?
1: I guess
2: And it's not just not hearing or seeing!
2: Some hear most stuff, but some frequencies are difficult
1: Sure
2: And not everyone watches TV in a cinema either, right?
1: Most watch it at home I would guess.
2: Yeah, and other people might be living there too
1: So?
2: So watching an action movie you might have to choose between explosions waking the kids or hearing the dialogue...
1: Yeah, I know. We use subtitles for that
2: Many do!
1: So - what's the solution?
2: People should be able to adapt the content however they like!
1: Um. How does that work?
2: Well, you can turn on subtitles, right?
1: Some times I can. Some times I can't...
2: Yeah, it can be surprisingly difficult...
1: And often the text is SO in the way!
2: Yes, it can be a bit on the big side
1: And be like this huge black strip
2: Some times it's just floating right on the picture, and that can be really difficult too!
1: Yes, I saw a french film like that
2: Anyway - you know web pages?
1: Yes?
2: They use responsive design. That's why it works both on a tablet, a phone and a computer
1: Right - when things change to fit the screen?
2: Yes. And that's not difficult to use, right?
1: No, that's very easy. I mean - I just rotate my screen if I want it wider
2: Exactly, and the content reformats itself
1: Yeah. Mostly I think it works quite well in any direction, so I normally just watch in the most comfortable way
2: But videos isn't quite like that, right?
1: No, they just fit in the screen, and then all the rest is black or full of other stuff
2: Exactly! So why are they so much worse do you think?
1: I don't know. They are old fashioned?
2: Sort of... Video is basically like a film roll still, with a player that runs the film strips one frame after the other
1: They must be a bit more modern?
2: A bit, but it's the same fundamental idea.
1: And that works well then, as it's still being used?
2: Well, web pages can be reformatted because they are not all bound together up front. It's a buch of different bits and some descriptions of how to arrange them
1: So each picture should be sent separately? That sounds a bit inefficient!
2: You are right, that wouldn't work. But even if the video is a video, it doesn't mean that everything must be shown
2: or that everything needs to be in the video
1: What's everything to you?
2: Well, it could be the subtitles. Or a sign language translator. Or audio descriptions.
2: Or it could be more advanced stuff, like a 3D map, animations, information about people... Anything really
1: But you can't just put all that up on a TV!
2: No, that's true. But you can show some of it. And people could use their phones and tablets too!
1: Like second screen stuff? That's just frustratingly difficult to use!
2: Not if you do it right!
1: And how is right?
2: Well - let's say you watch NRK on something
1: Ok
2: Then you go to nrk.no and that's it.
1: Um. That's not how it works.
2: No it isn't. But that's how it is going to work!
1: How?
2:
