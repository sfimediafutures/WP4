{"voice": 1, "text": "Accessibility is the worst."},
{"voice": 2, "text": "What? Why?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "The text is too visible and the sign language translator takes like 40% of the screen."},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Yeah. You know, it's just because it's not done right..."},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Really? How so?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Well, people are different, right?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "I guess"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "And it's not just not hearing or seeing!"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Some hear most stuff, but some frequencies are difficult"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Sure"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "And not everyone watches TV in a cinema either, right?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Most watch it at home I would guess."},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Yeah, and other people might be living there too"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "So?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "So watching an action movie you might have to choose between explosions waking the kids or hearing the dialogue..."},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Yeah, I know. We use subtitles for that"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Many do!"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "So - what's the solution?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "People should be able to adapt the content however they like!"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Um. How does that work?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Well, you can turn on subtitles, right?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Some times I can. Some times I can't..."},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Yeah, it can be surprisingly difficult..."},
{"voice": 1, "text": "And often the text is SO in the way!"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Yes, it can be a bit on the big side"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "And be like this huge black strip"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Some times it's just floating right on the picture, and that can be really difficult too!"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Yes, I saw a french film like that"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Anyway - you know web pages?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Yes?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "They use responsive design. That's why it works both on a tablet, a phone and a computer"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Right - when things change to fit the screen?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Yes. And that's not difficult to use, right?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "No, that's very easy. I mean - I just rotate my screen if I want it wider"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Exactly, and the content reformats itself"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Yeah. Mostly I think it works quite well in any direction, so I normally just watch in the most comfortable way"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "But videos isn't quite like that, right?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "No, they just fit in the screen, and then all the rest is black or full of other stuff"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Exactly! So why are they so much worse do you think?"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "I don't know. They are old fashioned?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Sort of... Video is basically like a film roll still, with a player that runs the film strips one frame after the other"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "They must be a bit more modern?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "A bit, but it's the same fundamental idea."},
{"voice": 1, "text": "And that works well then, as it's still being used?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Well, web pages can be reformatted because they are not all bound together up front. It's a buch of different bits and some descriptions of how to arrange them"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "So each picture should be sent separately? That sounds a bit inefficient!"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "You are right, that wouldn't work. But even if the video is a video, it doesn't mean that everything must be shown"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "or that everything needs to be in the video"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "What's everything to you?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Well, it could be the subtitles. Or a sign language translator. Or audio descriptions."},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Or it could be more advanced stuff, like a 3D map, animations, information about people... Anything really"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "But you can't just put all that up on a TV!"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "No, that's true. But you can show some of it. And people could use their phones and tablets too!"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Like second screen stuff? That's just frustratingly difficult to use!"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Not if you do it right!"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "And how is right?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Well - let's say you watch NRK on something"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Ok"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Then you go to nrk.no and that's it."},
{"voice": 1, "text": "Um. That's not how it works."},
{"voice": 2, "text": "No it isn't. But that's how it is going to work!"},
{"voice": 1, "text": "How?"},
{"voice": 2, "text": "Let me tell you!"}
